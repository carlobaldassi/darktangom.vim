This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1672

Based on the color specifications of www.tango-project.org.

I've been using this color scheme, for a couple of weeks now. It's not complete but I really like it. For suggestions etc feel free to email me.

DarkTango, fits great with Tango desktop themes and all that is Tango-ish!

Enjoy!
